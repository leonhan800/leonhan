											<h3>Birds Eye Exploded View of Tray</h3>
<p>Our design addresses the need for people living with motor function impairments, such as cerebral
	palsy, to wash their hands unassisted at home. Due to limited arm flexibility and hand strength, as well
	as the ineffectiveness of current solutions, it can be difficult for clients to apply, lather, and rinse soap.
	To address this, our tray is designed to fit onto the client's wheelchair and has a curved surface with a
	water exit hole that allows for easy and effective rinsing. Our solution also includes an automatic
	Arduino faucet, which delivers water without the need to physically flick up a faucet, and an automatic
	soap dispenser located on the water-resistant tray. The tray also includes loofahs and other soft
	materials, which allow the client to properly lather their hands with soap for cleanliness.
	Here are the steps that the client will follow to properly wash their hands:
	1. Firstly, they will use an external automatic soap dispenser to apply soap onto their hands.
	2. They will then rub their hands horizontally on the loofahs to work up a rich lather with the
	soap.
	3. Next, they will hover their hand over the ultrasonic sensor to activate the water pump, which
	will dispense a refreshing stream of water onto their hands.
	4. Lastly, they will place their hands under the tube that is connected to the water pump to rinse
	and lather their hands with water, ensuring that all the soap has been washed away.</p>											<ul class="actions">

											<h3>Arduino Circuit - Aayush Bhanot</h3>
<p>The circuit function works by utilizing an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence or absence of an object in its
	proximity. The ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves, which bounce off the object and return to
	the sensor. Once the sensor has detected the object, it sends a signal to a relay module. The relay module acts
	as a switch, allowing the sensor to control the pump. When the sensor sends the signal to the relay module, the
	module activates a circuit that triggers the pump to turn on. The pump then allows water to travel through the
	pipe. The pump and sensor work together to allow the client access to water without the need to flick up a
	faucet</p>											<ul class="actions">
